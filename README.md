## Technologies

###Classification
- Python: General-purpose programming language for deep learning and data processing.
- TensorFlow & Keras: Deep learning framework used to build, train, and optimize neural networks.
- MobileNetV2: A lightweight, pre-trained deep learning model optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications.
- Dense, GlobalAveragePooling2D: Layers used in deep learning models for feature extraction and classification.
- Dropout: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting.
- Regularizers: Used for adding penalties to the model to improve generalization.
- EarlyStopping: A callback that stops training when performance stops improving, preventing overfitting.
- TensorFlow Keras ImageDataGenerator: Performs real-time image augmentation to increase dataset diversity.
- OpenCV (cv2): Used for additional image processing, such as resizing, filtering, and transformations.
- KaggleHub & KaggleDatasetAdapter: Enables access to datasets from Kaggle for training and testing.
- Google Colab (files module): Used to upload and download files within Google Colab.
